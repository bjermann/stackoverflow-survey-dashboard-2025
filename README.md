## Project Overview
This dashboard is part of my **Breaking Into Tech** series. After a decade in Finance, I'm analyzing real developer data to understand the Technology industry. 
This dashboard explores **49,000+ Stack Overflow Developer Survey responses** to uncover trends in AI adoption, compensation, and learning pathways â€” insights that are guiding my own transition into Tech.

## Key Insights

**ðŸ“š How Developers Learn<br/>**
â®•**Technical documentation leads at 68% usage** across both new learners and professionals, making it the most reliable learning resource<br/>
â®•**39% of Gen Z developers list coding challenges as their preferred format, yet only 15% used them in the past year to learn.** This 24-percentage-point gap between preference and usage signals an underserved market opportunity: platforms that can deliver engaging, high-quality coding challenges could capture significant user growth by meeting this unmet demand, particularly among the next generation of developers.
<br/>
<br/>
**ðŸ¤– The AI Paradox<br/>**
â®•**78% of developers use AI tools, yet 46% distrust their accuracy.** The disconnect between high usage and low trust suggests developers have embraced AI as a productivity tool, using it for boilerplate code, documentation lookup, and prototyping while still applying critical judgment to outputs</br>
â®•**64% believe AI is not a threat to their current jobs**, reinforcing that AI is viewed as an assistant rather than a replacement technology.<br/>
â®ž**The takeaway: AI literacy is expected, but human judgment remains irreplaceable**
<br/>
<br/>
**ðŸ’° The Compensation Curve</br>**
â®•**Mid-career developers (6-10 years) see the steepest salary growth**: a 45% jump from $100K to $145K. After crossing the 10-year mark, growth slows substantially to just 17% over the next decade, reaching $170K at 16+ years
